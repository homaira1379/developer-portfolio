## 💭 Part 1 Reflection

Building this portfolio taught me the power of React's component-based architecture and state management. I learned how to effectively use props to pass data between components and how `.map()` makes rendering dynamic lists effortless. The most challenging aspect was implementing conditional rendering for the featured badges and the Show More/Less toggle. Seeing all my real projects displayed beautifully in one place was incredibly rewarding, and knowing this portfolio will grow with me throughout my developer journey gives me immense satisfaction.

## 💭 Part 2 Reflection

Building the interactive features taught me about managing complex state, useEffect for side effects, and localStorage for data persistence. The toughest challenge was implementing the debounced email validation and ensuring the theme persisted across page reloads. My favorite creative addition was the three-theme toggle system (Light/Dark/Ocean) with smooth transitions, making the portfolio feel truly personalized and dynamic.
